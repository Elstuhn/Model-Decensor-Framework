# Decensoring of Models using Model Abliteration
Used orthogonal decomposition to abliterate models to achieve a 56.7% decrease in censoring 

60.83% (73/120) => 4.17% (5/120) censor rate

# Dataset
Dataset used was quite lenient thus original model had a censor rate of 60.83%

# Next
Uploading decensor framework soon
